## üìï About

A simple API that emulates the flow of an e-commerce, at a limited scope. This project's purpose is solely
to learn and get familiarized with NodeJS's ecosystem.

## Technologies used

- Typescript
- ExpressJS
- Postgres
- Esbuild
- Docker

## ‚öíÔ∏è How to use

### Database

The postgres database has 3 main entities: `users, categories and products`. Other models derive from these three.

The tables are: `users, categories, products, orders, product_categories and order_products`. The last three represent,
respectively, the order (like a shopping cart) of an user, created automatically when a new user is created;
the many-to-many relationship table between a product and it's categories, and lastly the products contained in an order.

To initialize the database, use the `npm run start:db` command. This will also create a "super user" with max access level,
capable of performing all operations on all entities of the database, execpt deleting/updating another user's data.

Be sure to populate the `.env` files before running Docker compose.

### Routes

The application has 5 main routes: `users, categories, products, orders and auth`. Below is a map of all available
operations. Routes marked with "protected" require authentication.

```
  /users
    GET /profile (protected) -> returns info about the user that made the request
    GET / (protected) (access_level: 2) -> gets many users
    POST /create (protected) (access_level: 3) -> creates a new user
    DELETE / (protected) -> deletes own account
```

```
  /categories
    GET / -> returns a page of categories
    GET /:categoryID -> returns info about a single category
    POST / (protected) (access_level: 2) -> creates a new category
    POST /add-to-product (protected) (access_level: 2) -> adds an existing category to an existing product
    DELETE /delete-from-product (protected) (access_level: 2) -> removes a category from a product
    DELETE /:categoryID (protected) (access_level: 2) -> deletes a category
```

```
  /products
    GET / -> returns a page of products without their categories
    GET /:productID -> returns data from a single product, with it's categories included
    POST / (protected) (access_level: 2) -> creates a new product, optionally adding it's categories too
    PUT /:productID (protected) (access_level: 2) -> updates data of a single product, without changing categories
    DELETE /:productID (protected) (access_level: 2) -> deletes a single product
```

```
  /orders
    GET / (protected) -> returns products of currently signed in user
    POST /product (protected) -> adds a product to order
    POST /checkout (protected) -> performs checkout (simply deletes products from order and decreases each product stock)
    DELETE /product (protected) -> deletes a single product from the order
```

```
  /auth
    POST /login -> performs login, returning an access token and a refresh token
    POST /signup -> adds a new user to the system, also returning an access token and a refresh token
```

### Authentication

To access a protected route (given the user has the required access level), he must use an access token (JWT), by appending it to the Authorization header.

`Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`.

The access token has a short lifespan, so to ensure the user doesn't need to login often, a refresh token also must be used, by appending it into the `refreshToken cookie`. Both tokens are provided when a user access the login/signup routes.

The general flow is as follows:

- User performs login -> access token + refresh token provided.
- User access protected route by passing access token.
- After the access token expires, the passed refresh token is used to generate a new access token.
- User saves the new access token, and tries to access the route again, this time successfully.
- When the refresh token expires, the user must perform login again.
